HELP: INSTALLATION TASK
=======================

Options:
  -t <task>
     The task to be run, in this case we want to run the installation task so set it to "install".

  -u <db username>
     The database user assigned the rights to use the database. Depends on -t <task> to be set to "install".

  -p <db password>
     The password associated with the database user. Depends on -t <task> to be set to "install".

  -n <db name>
     The database name you want to create or re-use. Depends on -t <task> to be set to "install".
     NOTE: If you type the name of an existing database, keep in mind that the
           installation process will drop that database and re-create it.

  -h <help>
     Provides a list of supported options. Depends on -t <task> to be set to "install".

Examples:

  case: Install the database with name "forumsdb".
  ./sites/all/scripts/tasks/trigger -t install -u root -p rootpass -n forumsdb

  case: Get installation task help.
  ./sites/all/scripts/tasks/trigger -t install -h

Troubleshooting:

  case: MAMP related DB connection refused.
